<h1>Hardware Store Project</h1>
<p>This is a project done to practice skills I learned in C++. In the project, there was practice with classes, file handling, console output manipulation, operator overloading, seperation of class files and implementation files, and a strong focus on documentation and code readability. </p>


<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>Users should be able to load predefined data from dataFile.txt. Allow the user to change tool records; update, delete, etc. Each tool is a hardware object. Allow the user to close the database. Keep a record of each tool position in the file. The user should be able to print out the contents of the file in order of tool id. Files are stored as binary files. </p>


<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Operator Overloading is helpful when working with user-defined structures</li>
  <li>File Handling is useful when working with large amounts of data</li>
  <li>Object size is important to make sure each tool is stored properly in the file</li>
  <li>The ability to document code well allows for future edits and readability.</li>
</ul>
