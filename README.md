<h1>Hardware Store Final Project</h1>
<p>This is a project done for my introductory C++ class. In the project, there was practice with classes, file handling, console output manipulation, and more. </p>
<p>Note, "database" is in quatations because this is more file manipulation rather than a database. </p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>From dataFile.txt, load the "database" with data. Allow the user to change tool records; update, delete, etc. Each tool is a hardware object. The choice was up to the student as to whether to use a class or a struct, I chose the class approach. Allow the user to close the "database." Keep a record of tool position in the file. The user should be able to print out the contents of the file in order. Files are stored as binary files. </p>
